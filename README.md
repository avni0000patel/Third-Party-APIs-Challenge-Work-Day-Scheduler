# 05 Third-Party-APIs-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler
In this project I have created a work day scheduler so I can manage my time effectively. This work day scheduler allows me to add important events to a daily planner. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
